While only the docker version of align3d and shr3d is fully supported, it is possible to successfully build on windows. The following instructions demonstrate one path to a successful build.

Download and run OSGeo4W64 (64-bit) Installer (http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe)
	Select advanced installation. Everything else until packages is default.
		From Command Line Utilities select:
			Gdal, gdal-dev, pdal
		Install packages to meet dependencies (page after package selection).

If you did not install OSGeo4W64 in the standard location (C:\OSGeo4W64), do the following:
	In CMakeLists.txt, modify SET(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "...") to point to your OSGeo4W64 install directory
	Edit ...\OSGeo4W64\lib\pdal\cmake\PDALConfig.cmake, ...\OSGeo4W64\lib\pdal\cmake\PDALTargets.cmake, and ...\OSGeo4W64\lib\pdal\cmake\PDALTargets-relwithdebinfo.cmake so that all references to C:\OSGeo4W64 are replaced with the actual install location.

Download and install visual studio 2017 community (REQUIRES SYSTEM-RESTART)
	Install packages:
		Desktop development with c++
			** include c++/cli support and std lib mods **

Open Visual Studio
	Select File->Open->Folder..., and browse to and select the pubgeo folder
		Visual studio will process the cmake file, and create a .vs folder within the pubgeo folder
			Confirm CMake output does not show any errors
		Select CMake->Build All
			Confirm Build output shows "Build succeeded."
			Verify shr3d.exe and align3d.exe exist in the pubgeo/build/x64-Debug folder

Open command prompt
	Run ...\OSGeo4W64bin\o4w_env.bat; this will configure required environment variables for the session
	cd to ...\pubgeo\build\x64-Debug
	Run align3d or shr3d:
		align3d.exe ...\path\to\reference.las ...\path\to\alignMe.las gsd=1.0 maxt=10.0
		shr3d.exe ...\path\to\shr3dMe.las DH=2 DZ=1 AGL=2 AREA=50
